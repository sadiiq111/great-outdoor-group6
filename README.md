# The Great Outdoors 🌲

The Great Outdoors is a project dedicated to helping people explore the Pacific Northwest responsibly while protecting its natural landscapes.

## 🌄 Background

**Evan Holt** is a lifelong Pacific Northwest resident, former wilderness guide, and outdoor educator. After spending over **15 years** leading guided hikes and teaching *Leave No Trace* principles throughout Oregon and Washington, Evan noticed several ongoing challenges faced by hikers and outdoor enthusiasts:

- New hikers struggle to find **accurate, centralized, and up-to-date trail information**
- Popular trails are **overcrowded**, while lesser-known trails remain **underused**
- Many existing websites are **outdated**, difficult to navigate, or overly focused on **gear advertising** rather than safety and stewardship

## 🌱 Mission

Founded in **2024**, **The Great Outdoors** aims to:

- Promote responsible and sustainable outdoor exploration  
- Improve access to reliable trail and safety information  
- Encourage discovery of lesser-known trails to reduce overcrowding  
- Support conservation and *Leave No Trace* ethics  

## 🧭 Vision

By combining education, thoughtful design, and up-to-date trail data, The Great Outdoors seeks to create a more balanced, informed, and respectful outdoor community across the Pacific Northwest.
