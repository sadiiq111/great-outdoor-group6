**Steps to resolve conflicts:**

1. **Address early:** Speak up when concerns arise  
2. **Active listening:** Listen to understand, assume positive intent  
3. **Focus on problem, not person:** Discuss actions and ideas, not personalities  
4. **Understand perspectives:** Ask questions to learn different viewpoints  
5. **Find common ground:** Identify points of agreement  
6. **Brainstorm solutions together:** Work collaboratively  
7. **Agree on next steps:** Define who does what by when  
8. **Follow up:** Check that resolution is working
