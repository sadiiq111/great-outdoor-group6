    <h2>Leave No Trace Principles</h2>
    <p>
      Leave No Trace is a set of outdoor ethics designed to protect wild spaces for future visitors and the wildlife that calls them home. The core idea is simple: your visit should leave the landscape looking exactly as you found it, or better. When every hiker makes small, thoughtful choices, the combined impact is enormous.
    </p>
    <p>
      In practice, this means packing out everything you brought in — including food wrappers, fruit peels, and any other waste — and leaving natural objects like rocks, wildflowers, and pinecones exactly where you find them. Each element plays a role in the local ecosystem, and even small removals add up when multiplied across thousands of visitors.
    </p>

  <section id="trail-impact">
    <h2>Trail Impact Reduction</h2>
    <p>
      Staying on marked and designated trails is one of the most effective ways to protect the land around you. Wandering off-path — even just a few feet — tramples fragile vegetation, compacts soil, and creates erosion that widens over time. Switchbacks are designed to reduce slope damage, so cutting them causes real harm even when it looks like a harmless shortcut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping noise levels low is equally important, both for wildlife and for fellow hikers seeking a peaceful experience. Loud music or shouting can disrupt animals during feeding, nesting, or resting — and it takes away the natural quiet that makes the outdoors worth visiting in the first place.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="wildlife-responsibility">
    <h2>Wildlife Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      Always maintain a safe, respectful distance from any animal you encounter on the trail. A simple rule: if an animal changes its behavior because of your presence — moving away, freezing, or staring — you are already too close. This applies to all wildlife, from small birds and deer to bears and mountain lions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never feed wildlife, even animals that seem small or friendly. Human food is harmful to animals' health, and feeding them conditions them to associate people with food — a behavior that frequently leads to dangerous encounters and the removal or euthanasia of the animal. Observe quietly from a distance, and always let the animal's comfort take priority over your curiosity.
